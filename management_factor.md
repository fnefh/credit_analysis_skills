## The Management Factor

"Companies with management cultures and strategies focused on rapid and aggressive growth in revenues, earnings, stock value, and/or executive compensation often create a heightened credit risk profile."

-Cliff Griep, Executive Managing Director and Chief Credit Officer, Standard & Poor's

It would be an understatement to say that the role of management is pivotal to a company's performance and therefore its credit quality. Through most of this book, the importance of management, its strategies, its execution, and its decisions, is continually and incessantly reinforced. In addition, corporate management's financial philosophies and policies are a critically important component of credit analysis, since they establish the financial risk tolerance inherent in the company's actions. You should note that this chapter is deliberately placed between the chapters on business risk and financial risk.

While country qualities, the business environment, and the quality of a company's assets all set the framework and the path for success or failure, it is up to the management team to keep the company on that path and to utilize its assets effectively within the given environment to generate the best operating and financial performance possible. That is a daunting challenge for a management team, especially considering that it is competing against other managements with the same challenges. That is exactly why an evaluation of management is so important to the credit decision.

## EVALUATING MANAGEMENT

Management should be assessed for its operational and financial successes and failures, but also for the amount of risk it is willing to accept in order to deploy its strategies and policies. An objective analysis based on management's track record is valuable. That is, what is the level of risk taken, what is the return on investment, and is this risk/return a commensurate trade-off?

Visible evidence of the success or failure of decision making as reflected in financial or operating performance is hard to refute. However,

some could argue that it is difficult to discern whether performance occurred because of good management, happened without any management influence, or was achieved despite management. That's a good point, but it is not sufficient to conclude an evaluation of management after just one review of its financial or operating track record. It occurs over time and in conjunction with a more subjective viewpoint.

Analysts have many opportunities to get to know a senior management team if they really want to. Quarterly and periodic financial analyst meetings and teleconferences, the annual shareholders' meeting, and the occasional road show before bond and stock offerings are some of the public meeting opportunities, and attendance at these events is a mandatory responsibility for any credit analyst. It is at these meetings that senior management shares its business strategies with analysts as best it can without divulging secrets to competitors.

Outside of those public meetings, analysts should take the additional opportunity to personally call or visit key executives to further probe their strategy and prospects, but also to better gauge management itself. It is with this combination of objective and subjective evaluation that analysts can best determine the degree of management's influence on company performance, the effectiveness of its execution of its strategy, and the level of risk it is willing to tolerate.

For example, strategy and operating plans should be viewed with an eye toward reality; if the goals are not realistic-in terms of industry dynamics or the business environment-then the analyst should be skeptical of the company's chances of success. Analysts should compare a company's performance with its previous stated operating plans, as this establishes management's credibility. Past deviance from strategy is an indicator of future deviance. During times of stress, management's credibility is an important consideration, since creditors either will rely on management's intentions toward its creditworthiness or will not trust management.

At this point, it is important to remember who owns the company and what is the mandate given to the senior managers. Companies are not owned by creditors; they are owned by public or private shareholders (although in bankruptcy cases, creditors may eventually become shareholders). Business strategy and financial policy are usually driven by shareholder desires for earnings growth and therefore common stock price growth. Credit lenders, on the other hand, want to get repaid and prefer that a company have consistent performance. There's plenty of overlap in the requirements of shareholders and creditors, as growing earnings and continuously improving financial performance meet both parameters.

Yet there's a conflict in the tolerance for risk taking. Shareholders often reward growth potential by bidding up the stock price, whereas creditors seek greater returns when risk is high, resulting in a greater cost to the company. So understanding the mindset of senior management is very important, as this will determine its level of risk taking. A management with a history of chasing growth aggressively should be viewed cautiously in comparison to a management that grows its company in a lock-step fashion. Aggressive firms enter new businesses or markets quickly-possibly without completed business plans-and frequently exit or restructure failures while taking losses on asset sales or write-offs. This may be offset by glorious financial successes, but credit analysts should consider the volatility appropriately, especially in comparison to other firms.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Let's remember that Character is one of the Cs in credit analysis. Corporate governance, or the manner in which a company is managed, is another very important area for a credit analyst to evaluate. Management with high integrity manages the company with integrity in regard to business ethics, internal control systems, the corporate culture it nurtures, its business strategies, and the value it delivers to shareholders, creditors, employees, business counterparts, and customers.

To credit lenders and investors, integrity means that management is willing to repay its financial obligations on time and in full. This may sound surprising, but history is rife with business leaders who have had dubious intentions. Other qualities of a management with integrity that an analyst should be aware of are:

- ◆ Accessible to answer questions
- ◆ Answers questions without deception
- ◆ Discloses transparent information
- ◆ Discusses strategy and other activities openly
- ◆ Actually executes its stated strategy
- ◆ Never does anything surprising
- ◆ Is up front about challenges and problems

Managements with these qualities eventually become trusted because they are open and honest, and they provide information that is useful for a credit decision. Yet it is difficult to say that these qualities will

result in a higher opinion of a company's credit than would have been given without them. However, in the reverse, a management without these qualities may leave the analyst with many unanswered questions. Uncertainty should always result in a more conservative credit decision.

Corporate governance analysis involves more than just evaluating senior executives' integrity. It also involves the level of aggressiveness and risk taking in an organization, and the effectiveness of the checks and balances that keep decision making focused on the good of the company and not some other goal. Most corporations are managed with the proper focus. Still, there are pressures on corporate executives to continually generate better and stronger earnings, in the hope that this will lead to a rising common stock price.

Unfortunately, through the course of corporate history, there are common traits of companies that fall away from good corporate governance, leading to a disconnect from its best business strategy. Typically, in these cases, the tone is set by senior managers, who establish overly aggressive sales and profit targets, combined with excessive compensation policies that reward achieving the targets and do not tolerate failure. This type of culture breeds exaggeration of prospects and performance. It leads to aggressive accounting practices and lax internal controls. In most cases, it leads to sudden declines in performance and sizable write-offs of assets. In the worst cases, it results in outright fraud and then bankruptcy, e.g., Enron, WorldCom, and Parmalat.

Figure 4-1 is a helpful list of traits to consider, not only when evaluating a company's governance, but also when doing an overall evaluation of management. While any of these factors in isolation may not necessarily indicate problems, these behaviors can potentially create an environment susceptible to rapid credit deterioration at a corporation.

## FINANCIAL POLICY

Accounting practices, spending levels, debt tolerance, merger activity, and asset sale frequency are all aspects of a management's financial policies. Each of them shapes a company's financial risk profile and has some bearing on its future financial performance. While corporate management is expected to attempt to make economic decisions in everything it does, those decisions (economic or otherwise) will differ from company to company because of the different financial policies and different risk orientations employed by each firm. These differences could be driven by various factors, including personal values, the business's dynamics, and/or shareholder values.

Unfortunately for lenders, business decisions are infrequently made "for the good of the creditors" (except in dire circumstances). Instead, business decisions are assumed to be "for the good of the business." Even so, since corporations are owned by shareholders and not by creditors, it should not be surprising if management's decisions, including its financial policies, are largely driven by shareholder demands. Theoretically this, too, should be "for the good of the business," but it may narrowly be focused on benefiting earnings.

For example, earnings growth goals could encourage management to pursue a strategy of aggressively leveraged acquisitions at any cost, rather than a careful strategy of balancing internal growth with acquisitions. On the premise that corporate management is under various pressures to perform, and that these pressures drive financial policies, the analyst's job is to determine how much business and financial risk management is willing to accept and how much it employs.

Corporate management that is blindly driven by quarter-to-quarter earnings growth no doubt has too narrow an emphasis. Worse yet, a similar culture can develop throughout a company as employees learn from their managers. The subtle signs of an aggressive organization that is focused solely on earnings growth can be found (not easily) in its accounting practices. Gradually more liberal revenue recognition and expense deferrals may lead to better earnings in the near term, but create tremendous pressure over the longer term to truly expand financial performance. Additional pressures could lead to further liberalization of accounting practices and eventually to unsustainable expectations.

Monitoring what corporate management says it will do versus what it actually does can be very telling. For example, an organization's leverage goals "need to be viewed in context of its past record and the financial dynamics affecting the business." $^{1}$An entity that is increasing its cap-

pending beyond its cash-generating abilities should not be forecasting declining leverage unless there is a corresponding plan to sell assets or common equity. A skeptical analyst would question management on how exactly it plans to achieve both goals. The answers, and the company's subsequent performance, paint the risk-tolerance picture and maybe even give clues with regard to the integrity of management's words.

No corporation is expected to be risk-free. In fact, a riskless financial policy is usually suboptimal in the corporate world, as increasing use of debt (up to certain levels) is known to enhance overall returns on investment-assuming that the money was invested wisely. Financial policies should be consistent with the needs of the business and the environment affecting it. Growth industries typically require externally financed spending because the anticipated cash flows may not have been generated yet. Mature, established businesses may not have sufficient internal growth and may require acquisitions to meet their earnings growth goals. In these cases, the investment strategy may be appropriate for the business, but the question is how aggressive the financing strategy is in relation to the business.

Corporate managers are not usually constrained when it comes to financial policy decisions (with the exception of managers of start-up companies and financially troubled entities). In the review of the financial profile and performance (see the upcoming chapter on financial risk), analysts should be eyeing the level of aggressiveness (or conservatism). For instance, constant borrowing and a highly debt-leveraged balance sheet is an aggressive financial strategy for a volatile company that is generating negative free cash flow. But an entity with stable assets-with assured cash generation-can be leveraged more even if free cash flow is negative.

In our experience, corporate management rarely makes financial or business decisions that are solely designed to improve the company's credit profile. Instead, corporate management finds a credit risk level that meets their risk-tolerance views. They subsequently manage the company toward the twin goals of maintaining credit quality and meeting shareholder demands. This becomes abundantly clear after analyzing their financing and investing decisions. However, history tells us that it is very difficult for companies to consistently apply their financial policies and achieve these twin goals during business and economic downturns. Credit deterioration is at its heaviest during these periods. Therefore, how management revises its strategies during-and preferably beforechanges in its business or in the economy can have an enormous impact on credit quality.

Financial policies set the tone for corporate risk tolerance and for the company's level of credit quality. Credit analysts need to be adept at recognizing the impact of management's financial policies and decisions:

- ◆ As to the culture they develop in the organization
- ◆ If they are consistent with announced goals and strategies
- ◆ If they are consistent with the business's dynamics
- ◆ As to their level of aggressiveness
- ◆ How they change with the environmental shifts affecting the business

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

## The Management Factor

The importance of management-its strategies, its execution, its decisions, its successes, and its failures-cannot be understated. It is not easy to determine the real impact that a management team has on a company, but a management's influence on the successes and failures of a company is irrefutable. Of course, the credit analyst is evaluating management's actions with an eye toward the degree to which they support credit quality. Since companies are owned by shareholders and not by creditors, the evaluation is also about management's tolerance for risk taking as well as its performance. Getting to know a management team and its proclivities is part of a credit analyst's job. There's plenty of opportunity to hear a management's strategies, but it takes some time to trust the managers' word.

Executives with integrity manage their companies with integrity. To a lender or investor, this means a willingness to repay financial obligations on time and in full, as well as being honest and transparent. Comparing the consistency of announced strategies with actual activities is one way to get an opinion of management's trustworthiness. But corporate governance analysis is more than just determining management's integrity; it is also important to monitor the stresses placed on a company, as this can and does influence management's actions. Shareholder demands for earnings growth can compel managers to act badly-that is, to pursue growth very aggressively or to vigorously account for revenues or expenses. There are many telltale traits that foretell governance risks that analysts should be keenly aware of.

Financial policies set the tone for all future decisions. While man-

agement is expected to make decisions based on sound economic analysis, those decisions will still be founded on the company's financial philosophies. No company should be completely riskless, but the financial risks that management accepts should be appropriate given the business and industry risks inherent in the company.

At this point, credit analysts will have completed the qualitative review of a company and all its risks. The cumulative impact of sovereign/country risks, industry risks, the specific company's business risks, and the influence of management should establish an opinion on whether the entity has high risk, average risk, or low risk. (See Chapter 11, "Measuring Credit Risk.") While this analysis is very useful to a credit analyst, it does not complete the entire risk picture yet. Now the analyst should evaluate the entity's financial performance and profile. In fact, a diligent credit evaluation of a company's financial performance and profile cannot and should not be done without an understanding of the level of qualitative risk inherent in the entity.
