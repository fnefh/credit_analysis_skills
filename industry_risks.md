## Industry Risks

"Industry risk assessment sets the stage for analyzing specific company risk factors and establishes the priority of these factors in the overall evaluation."

-Sol Samson, Managing Director, Standard & Poor's

This quotation highlights the interrelated nature of proper credit analysis (i.e., the building-block methodology). The previous chapter discussed how the makeup of a sovereign government and a country lead to the development of specific industries and business in general. This chapter will discuss how industry specifics lead to questions about individual companies, and how events at an individual company can affect that company's competitors and the industry as a whole.

Industry risk is defined as the risk of losing revenue or market share or incurring an overall financial decline as a result of industry changes, business cycles, product obsolescence, changes in consumer preferences, changes in technology, reduction in barriers to entry, or an increase in competition. The occurrence of industry risk is not just a recent phenomenon. One example dates back over 100 years, to the time of the horse and buggy.

The horse carriage-making industry was a thriving, successful business in the 1800s and early 1900s. Buggy-whip manufacturers were equally successful during this time. The leading manufacturers in both industries were creative and delivered well-constructed lines of products that pleased and satisfied most customers. Credit analysts (if they existed) at that time might have had a favorable view of these companies. Yet analyzing individual carriage and whip companies without analyzing the dynamics of the entire industry, satellite industries, and competing industries would have led to a major financial mistake back then, since the development of the automobile eventually made the horse-drawn carriage obsolete as a primary transportation vehicle. Lending institutions that did not see the connection and thus did not consider the industry's real risks

made poor credit decisions as a result. Those analysts and lenders who were on top of the situation probably knew that government intervention-that is, protection of the horse-carriage and buggy-whip industries-was not likely to occur. While this may be an antiquated and exaggerated example, it provides a lesson that credit analysts and especially lenders and investors frequently forget-that broad industry trends, new products, and competition can rapidly undermine industry relevance.

A more recent example of industry risk involves the link between the Internet and telecommunications firms during the 1990s. Both sectors had seemingly limitless upside potential. Venture capitalists and common stock investors fell over each other to invest insane amounts of money in numerous firms, even if they were only remotely involved with the Internet. Although the success of Internet enterprises was based on a fundamental assumption that high growth rates and demand would continue, many lenders, bond investors, and credit rating agencies accurately recognized that the purely Internet-related firms were very high risk because of pervasive competition encouraged by low barriers to entry, and flawed business models in which their ability to make money was questionable. While stock prices soared, the interest charged on loans to these entities was relatively high, reflecting the risk inherent in these companies and their individual Internet businesses. When a majority of those companies failed to make profits or generate free cash, the number of shuttered Web sites and defaulted companies skyrocketed. So, even though analysts correctly identified the industry risk associated with Internet companies (implied by the sector's high cost of capital), investors still lost money. Furthermore, investors compounded their losses by investing in fledgling telecommunications companies.

Telecommunications companies are the backbone of the Interneti.e., the entities with the physical cable and fiber optics that deliver the Internet content to subscribers. The primary participants are the massive well-established and well-financed "regional Bell operating companies" (RBOCs). Revenue prospects for data delivery (as opposed to voice delivery) are tied to the demand for the content delivered. (A similar analogy is retail stores, whose performance depends on the demand for the products made by others but sold within the store.)

One would think that the barriers to entry in this business would be high, since it took billions of dollars to build these networks and that the RBOCs had significant advantages because of their size, financial wherewithal, and incumbency. But the barriers came down, as investorsarmed with their assumptions that Internet demand would spur demand

for telecommunication services-were abundantly liberal with their money. In fact, brand new companies emerged with fresh capital destined to build out regional and national fiber-optic networks. However, the national U.S. telecommunications network became massively overbuilt once many Internet content firms went bust due to lack of demand. While the RBOCs were able to withstand the quick downturn of this business, most of their new competitors could not. Investors and lenders to the new entrants in the sector lost a lot of money. See "U.S. Telecoms' Credit Quality: A Migration Story" at the end of this chapter. The two foremost reasons, therefore, to thoroughly evaluate an industry and not just an individual company within that industry are to:

- 1. Assess the industry's short- and long-term sales growth trends and potential, and the events and competitors that challenge those prospects.
- 2. Assess how strong or weak the targeted company is within that industry, especially in comparison to competitors

Different industries pose different risks and opportunities for the companies that operate in them. There are many aspects and attributes of an industry that should be examined to get the proper perspective on how much risk is inherent in that industry.

In this book, we will focus on the variability of business activity, what it takes to be in a certain industry sector, and how the risks inherent in an industry affect the level of credit risk. We will examine the following:

- ◆ Sales and revenue prospects
- ◆ Patterns of business cycles and seasonality
- ◆ Industry hurdles and barriers to entry
- ◆ Can industry risk limit a company's credit quality?

## SALES AND REVENUE PROSPECTS

Industries can be characterized in five ways with regard to their sales and revenue prospects. That is, an industry can be considered a growth industry, a mature industry, a niche sector, a global business, or highly cyclical. Each characterization can affect the way an analyst interprets the credit quality of the industry and its participants.

Agrowth industry is one that has not yet achieved sales in all possible markets but has great potential for sales growth in new markets, to

## How the Economy Affects Different Industries
| Industries Highly Affected by Economic Changes | Industries Moderately Affected by Economic Changes | Industries Slightly Affected by Economic Changes |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Paper and forestry, metals and mining | Telecommunications | Environmental services, including waste disposal |
| Large-scale manufacturing of capital goods and automotive products | Technology | Health care and pharmaceuticals |
| Airlines, shipping, trucking, and rail | Large-scale broadcasting and publishing | Regulated utilities |
| Homebuilding and building materials | Engineering and construction companies | Cable television |
| Oil and natural gas | Gaming | Military defense |
| Chemicals | | Branded consumer products |
| Retail, lodging, and restaurants | | |

new customers, for new products, and at a faster pace in general (greater than 5 percent) than other industries. Conversely, a mature industry is already selling to most possible customers and markets, and has growth potential that is roughly average compared to that of other industries (usually in the -5 to 5 percent range).

Niche sectors are small, narrow businesses or products within larger industries where the growth potential is meaningful and opportunistic for smaller participants and usually insignificant or marginally incremental for larger entities. A global business is typically a mature business whose sales are made across country boundaries. Therefore, the sales growth opportunities for competitors in a global industry can be substantial, but the logistical and political challenges can be daunting. Highly cyclical industries experience wide swings in demand (and supply), with peaks and troughs that are perfectly seen in hindsight but hard to pinpoint as they are occurring.

## Sales Growth and Pricing Power

A good metric for measuring an industry's growth, size, and general health is revenue generated by the entire industry. Later in this chapter, we will discuss the costs of business and thus an industry's profitability. All industries are quite diverse. How revenue is totaled can influence opinions of the industry's health. Credit analysts should carefully segment the different sectors within an industry to best compare them and other industries on an apples-to-apples basis. Furthermore, revenue is made up of two components, unit sales and price per unit, and analyzing the trends in both is important.

An industry that has good credit quality would obviously be one that is not just growing in size, but also growing at a consistent pace. Healthy industries are capable of consistently creating new products and services that will be and are demanded by a market. In addition, prospects for increasing product demand are the hallmark of a healthy industry. But the strongest industries sustain an environment of growing demand with stable to rising prices.

The concept of pricing power-the ability of the seller (not the market) to dictate price-occurs when demand exceeds supply and is important because it confirms the value of the industry's (or the company's) products and services. The perfect example is the broad health-care industry, where the need and demand for pharmaceutical drugs, medical equipment and devices, and health-care facilities will grow in perpetuity, without doubt! The success, growth, importance, and effectiveness of each sector within the health-care industry is greatly supported by the worldwide education system and funded by government, insurance, and private enterprises. Arguably, the health-care industry has the best longterm sales growth prospects of any industry, especially given global population growth, the rising average age of humans, and the apparently never-ending creation of new diseases and maladies.

In addition, the health-care industry possesses pricing power in first-world countries. Drugs and medical devices benefit from free-market pricing, while health-care facilities (hospitals and nursing homes) enjoy some price retention supported by the presence of insurance and government payment provisions. While the industry's ability to endlessly increase the cost of health care will ultimately be challenged in the future, the demand for health-care solutions is so great that pharmaceutical firms and medical device makers spend billions on research and development to create new products. Health-care facilities will continue to purchase and provide the most sophisticated medical solutions to their patients.

Rising prices will continue until these entities are prohibited from passing these costs and their associated profits on to the consumer through product and service prices.

## Mature Industries

Not all industries benefit from the same strong business fundamentals that the health-care sector enjoys. Many industries are considered mature. Credit analysts cannot be complacent and assume that a mature industry translates to one that has a stable growth pattern. It all depends on the supply and demand fundamentals. Mature industries constantly face shifting supply and demand balances that directly affect sales growth and pricing power. Large-scale manufacturers (makers of paper, chemicals, capital goods, automobiles, and so on) change their industry's supply balances with the opening and closing of manufacturing plants and the rise and fall of workers' hours. Plant capacity utilization is a good indicator of a manufacturing industry's health and especially of the industry's pricing power. Industries with low capacity utilization (below 80 percent, according to most economists' guidelines) typically experience flat to declining prices until demand picks up (usually as a result of seasonal or economic shifts; see later in this chapter) or until more plant capacity is taken out of service. High capacity utilization drives higher prices and encourages manufacturers to build more plants or increase workers' hours (double shifts and so on).

The entrance of new products shapes sales demand in mature industries. It's difficult to determine the ultimate impact of new products on existing products, but it is a critical piece of analysis that will shape the view of industry risks and drive many specific credit decisions. Credit analysts must always stay up-to-date with the latest product trends and new product innovations, and analyze their impact on other products. While the reality is that new products don't always succeed, the entrance of new products or improved existing products can influence the supply-demand dynamics.

First, a new product can make an existing product obsolete for a multitude of reasons, but most commonly because it is a superior product at a similar price. Second, a new product can become an alternative or substitute to an existing product, usually because it is a similar (not superior) product, but at a lower price. Third, new products can change the entire landscape entirely by generating new demand for all related products, much the way faster and faster semiconductors maintain the sales

demand for new computers and have spawned demand for better modems, monitors, and software products.

The best examples (but not the only examples) of all three of these scenarios can be found in the technology sector, where product innovation happens so quickly that today's top products become obsolete in a short period of time and the desire for futuristic products is insatiable.

## Niche Sectors

One of the key factors in understanding the sales growth and pricing power in mature industries is to follow the supply and demand patterns. Of course that's true for all types of industries, but the ramifications for niche sectors can be much more volatile. Companies operating in niches are attempting to take advantage of the inefficiencies of larger companies by focusing on a narrow line of products, thereby theoretically delivering a better product at a better price. Most industries have many thousands of small suppliers supporting the products constructed by larger companies. These niche companies are reliant on the success of the larger companies and face enormous competition. This is why niche companies are highrisk credits.

Agreat example is in the automotive industry, where the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford Motors, and Daimler Chrysler) are supplied by about 40 large suppliers, who in turn are supported by roughly 100,000 small niche auto parts manufacturing companies. These small entities are subject not only to the dynamics of the entire auto industry, but to the circumstances surrounding the individual suppliers and automakers they support. This is the typical life in a niche industry.

Therefore, niche companies' sales growth prospects and pricing power are typically considered to be at high risk. Credit analysts should be diligent in investigating alternative products and contractual arrangements with the larger entities, as well as the larger entities' sales prospects. Credit providers clearly should not overweight their loans to any one-niche entity.

## Global Firms

Global businesses encompass all of the risks and opportunities of a mature industry, but they are multiplied and complicated by scale. By definition, a global business is one in which competitors, suppliers, man-

ufacturers, distributors, and natural resources can and do produce and deliver from anywhere in the world. In reality, only large companies can effectively work and succeed on a global scale. The complication, however, is that competition for new business in any region of the world can be won by either local players or global companies, and the supply/demand dynamics-and therefore pricing power-are driven by both global and local circumstances.

It is with these industries that the building-block process of credit analysis is most valuable. Credit analysts must pay their best diligent attention to the relevant sovereign and country risks in these cases. For instance:

- ◆ Global supplies dictate global prices, but the availability of local supplies (and probably cheaper transportation costs) will affect local prices.
- ◆ Local tariffs on foreign products affect the prices of those products (and thus the companies' pricing power) and the overall desirability for foreign companies to be present in those countries.
- ◆ Local business regulations could favor local companies, affecting the winners and losers of new business.

Despite these apparent advantages to the local competitors, global companies can benefit from their size via lower costs, a broader array of international products, and more wherewithal to deliver a larger supply of products. Furthermore, global companies do try to act local where they can. Global companies gain local status, and possibly influence more favorable regulation, if they hire a significant number of locals as employees and if they generate a significant amount of tax revenues for the local government.

## Cyclical Sectors

Highly cyclical industries not only are greatly affected by swings in the general economy, but are also susceptible to wide variations in supply and demand dynamics that cause financial stress. Therefore, a major challenge for corporations in these industries is to achieve consistent sales performance. To moderate cyclical risks, many companies seek business diversity to soften the swings in performance. To complicate matters further, competition in these sectors is fairly intense, since the product tends

to be either a commodity (e.g., paper, metals, chemicals) or subject to retail consumer sentiment (e.g., autos, retail outlets, leisure).

Predictability of sales trends requires a keen understanding of the sector and all its threads, but even then recognizing the peaks and troughs of the industry's cycle is highly suspect. Nevertheless, credit analysts are best off charting industry sales on a regular basis and watching for shifts by the industry as a whole, by competitors, and by the company itself. The next section goes into greater detail on industry cyclicality.

## PATTERNS OF BUSINESS CYCLES AND SEASONALITY

"The reality is that weak companies usually don't have the benefit of waiting for a cyclical upturn!"

-Tom Kelly, Managing Director, Standard & Poor's

Every industry has a business cycle and is affected by the economic cycle in some way. However, industries are not all affected in the same manner by the swings in their businesses or the economy (see Table 2-1). Credit analysts have to be acutely aware of how industries and their individual participants react to these swings. Furthermore, credit analysts must be looking to the future by anticipating cycles, the possible impacts on sector supply and demand fundamentals, and the potential reaction by individual companies. Rating agencies believe that the value of their credit ratings is that they are based on a long-term view of the credit that does not fluctuate widely along with the economy or business cycles. This is true. However, swings in business performance, no matter what causes them, should certainly affect the lenders' decisions with regard to the size and tenor of loans.

## Cyclicality

Cyclicality is a negative that should be built into the business risk assessment. 1 Industries with frequent and wide swings in supply and demand during their cycles are inherently riskier than the more stable industries. Therefore, in anticipating these swings, credit analysts should evaluate the magnitude and timing of the peaks and the troughs of the cycles of

## TABLE 2-1: When Does the Economy Affect Certain Industry Sectors?

Automotive and auto suppliers; leisure, gaming, and lodging; building materials, homebuilders, and real estate; retailers and restaurants; textiles and apparel

Health care; food, beverage, and tobacco; food and drug retail; consumer products; utilities

Metals and mining; chemicals; oil and natural gas; telecommunications; cable television; capital goods; airlines and aerospace; paper; containers; technology; broadcasting and media; publishing and printing

different industry sectors. Of course, given the impossibility of predicting the top and bottom of cycles, this is a task that will be inaccurate, but it is important nonetheless, since it helps frame the future performance of individual companies. The stronger companies will be able to withstand the troughs of any cycle. That does not mean that their financial and operating performance will not decline. It probably will decline. But it does mean these companies typically build up financial resources, such as cash reserves, equity cushions, and available debt capacity, during the peaks of the cycles for use during the troughs of the cycles. Credit analysts should be recognizing the buildup of these resources in the up cycles and be skeptical of the future of companies that spend their wealth.

For example, technology companies (and automakers, too) usually carry a large amount of cash on hand because of the potentially wide and unpredictable swings in the demand for technology products. This cash is used to maintain product development and innovation (i.e., research and development). Nevertheless, technology firms often fail even though they may have promising products because they lack the resources to develop, market, and distribute these products when the tech business cycle is at a low.

The technology sector is not the only example. The chemical industry has one of the most complex business-cycle dynamics. Credit analysts who cover this industry know that demand for chemical products varies on the basis of both retail and industrial needs, whereas supplies vary on the basis of plant capacity (which is very expensive) and the availability of feedstocks (typically oil or natural gas). Since the availability of chemical feedstocks is affected by many factors other than demand for chemicals (for example, the demand for gasoline, jet fuel, and home heating fuel), this disconnect creates a complexity in forecasting the chemical cycles.

## Business Cycles

Don't be lulled into thinking that all business cycles are the same. There is no one typical cycle for any industry. In fact, with the development of computing technology and the reality of real-time deliveries, business cycles in the twenty-first century have been faster than those of the 1990s and earlier. It is dangerous to blindly assume that future cycles will behave like previous cycles. Credit analysts should just assume that the phases of the next cycle will be different in some way-longer or shorter, steeper or less severe-and not just a repeat of the last or any other cycle.

In addition, one could expect that corporate management learns from previous cycles and does not repeat past bad decisions. However, our experience is that poor managers continue to make bad decisions, and are not employed for long. Furthermore, global industries have to deal with multiple local and global cycles. So, it would not be wise to assume that history will exactly repeat itself in global businesses.

What has been consistent and should be expected is that weak companies become even weaker and more negatively volatile during troughs in cycles. Most defaults occur during troughs. This, of course, is why analyzing industry cycles is so important. The speed and magnitude of changes in market conditions can mean the difference between survival and failure for some companies. $^{2}$A cyclical downturn could shove a company into the grave, while a cyclical upturn could give the company a needed lift to build resources, to develop new products, and possibly to survive through the cycle to the next trough.

There are different types of cycles. The general business cycle incorporates the overall economic activity and business demand in either a national or a global sense. Demand-driven cycles are typically within individual sectors, such as the product-replacement cycles in the personal computer industry and its satellite industries (semiconductors, moni-

tors, modems, and so on). Supply-driven cycles are reflected in the capacity expansions and plant closings usually seen in the manufacturing sectors, such as in the paper, metals, and chemicals industries. The coincidence of these cycles occurring at the same time is not unusual. This does not necessarily complicate the analysis any further but it does magnify the cycle for the weaker industry participants.

## Seasonality

Seasonality is another type of cycle that affects only some industries (retailing, toys, agriculture, utilities, and energy, to name a few). Entities whose businesses are inherently seasonal will exhibit natural swings in their financial and operating performances that must be accepted and taken into consideration. Credit analysts should evaluate and forecast these companies' results on an annual and seasonal basis. In other words, it is important to analyze the annual performance of these types of companies, but at the same time it is important to fundamentally analyze their individual seasons.

For example, in the northern parts of the United States and Canada, natural gas utilities sell the very large majority of natural gas during the winter home heating months of November through February. As a result, these gas utilities make the large majority of their profits during the first and fourth quarters. The second and third quarters of any year are usually less profitable because this is when the utilities are expending capital to purchase gas supplies and fill up storage.

If an analyst were to evaluate credit risk based solely on one of these seasons, the result would be either an extreme positive or extreme negative view of the utility. Instead, analysts should take a longer-term perspective, incorporating this inherent industry seasonality.

For example, what happens during the summer gas supply season (e.g., the amount and cost of supplies purchased and stored) will affect a company's performance during the winter selling season. Conversely, the performance in the winter affects the activities in the summer. That is, if it is very cold and natural gas sales are high, financial performance will be good, but gas inventories will dwindle. A well-managed gas utility will build its financial resources during these good months so as to build supplies again during the summer without impairing its overall financial profile. 3

The somewhat more critical analysis of gas utilities is what happens during and after warm winter months, since financial performance will

be weaker, and the company will not be able to make up the difference during the subsequent months. This is when management's strategies and actions play an important role in the analysis.

Frankly, the changes in or the consistency of business strategies and financial policies in the different phases of cycles or seasons is critical to the performance of every company. It should not be surprising to witness shifts in management's style or aggressiveness as cycles change. For example, during a cyclical downturn, many entities would slow or eliminate growth efforts, whereas during cyclical rebounds, whole industries could experience widespread acquisition and expansion activities. Once again, credit analysts using the building-block methods would be aware (should be aware) of all the environmental factors affecting an industry or an individual company. During the various phases of a cycle, this awareness helps the analyst probe corporate executives on their business strategies and forecast future industry and company performances.

Business cycles by definition reflect the rise and fall of economic and business activity in an industry sector that result in the varying financial and operating performances of individual companies. Credit analysts should evaluate the impact of these cycles on individual industries and then evaluate individual managements' spending and borrowing decisions in order to effectively evaluate the financial performance of targeted credits.

## BARRIERS TO ENTRY

Barriers to entry, or hurdles, can come in many forms and can be either financial or nonfinancial in nature. Every industry has certain requirements-the proverbial entry ticket to the ball game-that it is absolutely essential that a company meet if it is to be able to conduct business in that industry. For some industries, these requirements are achievable, but still necessitate an investment in skills, resources, or hard assets, or need the benefit of time to develop business relationships, a reputation, and experience in general. Conversely, some hurdles are true barriers because the requirements are so expensive (in terms of time and money) or expansive (e.g., geographically or in terms of needed capabilities) that they are realistically very difficult to achieve.

An example of a high hurdle that has been leaped over and over again is in the electric power generation industry. To be able to sell electric power in just about any country, all any company needs to do is build an electric power plant and connect it to the local or regional power network. Electric power technology is 100 years old, and it is easily replicable.

The hurdles are twofold. First, suitable sites for the plant itself, the substations, and the above- or below-ground electric power lines must be located. It is usually difficult to find acceptable real estate within major cities. But this is not a particularly high hurdle, since power plants can be built away from cities in Greenfield locations 4 that are also reasonably close to the power grid (i.e., the network that sends the power throughout the region). Environmental issues, however, could make site location a major hurdle. Therefore, power generators have to expend a lot of effort to respond to the concerns of environmentalists and, of course, residents living near the site.

The second hurdle is the cost to build a power plant, which varies with the size and type of plant. Suffice it to say that the cost is not a small amount. Midsize power plants in the United States cost up to $500 million to construct, and large power plants cost billions of dollars. Given this substantial expense, an analyst could come to the conclusion that cost was a true barrier to building a power plant. The reality, though, is that many large and midsize power plants were built between 1993 and 2003. The demand for electricity during this period was so great that power companies, including many new entrants, were able to find investors and lenders who were willing to provide substantial amounts of capital to build these facilities. The lesson is not that hurdles are achievable, but that there is a cost to achieving hurdles. Analysts need to be aware of the hurdles and what it takes to resolve them because the cost of resolution can affect the economics of the business, and thus the credit quality.

## Hurdle Cost

There are several items to evaluate in a business to determine if there are hurdles. As we just noted, the cost to construct facilities or the capital intensity of an industry can be a major hurdle. Any industry requiring largescale assets, such as manufacturing plants, or requiring funds to extract natural resources, such as oil or metals, is going to be capital intensive. The need to access other people's money at times is a strong deterrent to new entrants. However, the marketplace's demand for an industry's products will determine how worthwhile it is for existing participants to build new facilities or for new entrants to come into the sector. If profit margins are wide enough, a corporation will seek to build new facilities. If the returns are healthy enough, investors and lenders will lend money for the construction. The role of the credit analyst is to evaluate the profit margins for the corporation and the availability (and cost) of capital to determine if

cost barriers are low or high. In the electric power industry, the nominal capital costs to build power plants are high, but when the demand for more power is high, the barriers to capital come down.

## Technology

The technology inherent in an industry, including the industry's rate of innovation or the rate of a product's obsolescence, creates an expectation from customers concerning the development of new products. This requires skilled employees and an effective innovation process that in fact leads to new products or product enhancements that meet customer needs. This is a significant hurdle for many companies.

A good example is in the semiconductor business. Andy Grove, former chief executive officer at Intel, was often quoted as saying "chip processing size and speed will double every 18 months." This was a challenge to the industry's technologists that was largely met throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Intel set the pace of innovation, and its competitors had to keep up or else go out of business (which happened to many). So, while employing skilled technicians is probably not a major hurdle for most semiconductor chip manufacturers, getting those technicians to develop faster and better products at the market's pace was significant. Regarding industry technology, credit analysts should investigate the sophistication required and what it takes to get it.

## Access to Customers

Access to customers can be a hurdle in many industries. The location and effectiveness of the distribution channels established by firms in the industry is critical to their success. In some cases, it could take a small industry participant many years to develop a level of customer access that is competitive with that of the major players. Take the retailing industry as an example. Major retailers (food distributors, clothing stores, appliance stores, home improvement centers, gasoline stations, and so on) have thousands of stores situated where those companies believe they are best located for easy access by their targeted customers. It is not especially difficult for new or existing industry players to find and construct such stores, but the cost and the time element are hurdles to evaluate.

Reputation is also a factor. Just having a product (or a store) does not mean that customers want it, will use it, or even know that it exists. The

barrier then involves marketing and creating a known brand. This is a critical component in highly competitive industries, such as consumer products, that rely heavily on customers recognizing and remembering their products. Credit analysts have to recognize that consumers are fickle and that maintaining access to a customer is an essential job for a company, especially those with intense competition.

## Suppliers

Access to suppliers and raw materials can be a hurdle, too. While some companies may be fully integrated and gather all the necessary supplies to create their specific product, most, if not all, firms rely heavily on other industries' products or services for supplies. Access to raw materials or to another company's products can be either easy or extraordinary, depending on the location of these materials or products and how they need to be delivered.

This is where a country's infrastructure plays a significant role. Access to harbors, airports, highways, and electric power is critical to the ability to deliver supplies. This isn't much of an issue in a well-developed country like the United States, but it is a substantial issue and expense in many other countries. Global industries, especially those involved with natural resources, have to deal with these issues. These include, but are not limited to, the oil, metals, and paper industries. While this may be a given in certain industries and certain countries, it is not a given everywhere or all the time. Credit analysts must be aware of the supply side of a business because shortages are a success killer.

The automotive industry is the best example of an industry with hurdles so high that they regularly affect existing manufacturers and are probably true barriers for new entrants. In the early 1900s, the auto industry was integrated, with the automakers actually constructing every part of the car. Today, automakers are large assemblers with dozens of facilities and many thousands of employees, and they essentially acquire every piece of their cars from thousands of suppliers. Given the magnitude of these operations, existing manufacturers are challenged to efficiently coordinate their efforts, and new entrants would be hard-pressed to replicate the asset base and the business relationships. Technology issues such as fuel efficiency, safety features, engine power, product design, and other esthetic features can be enormous, and slim profit margins do not permit much leeway in performance. Lastly, access to customers is a daunting task, especially considering the intense competition inherent in the auto

sector. While it might be possible for a new entrant to build a network of showrooms to sell its vehicles, getting the vehicle well enough known to encourage potential customers to come into the showrooms could be difficult and costly. Existing automakers spend a substantial sum every year on their national marketing campaigns to promote their vehicles. This is just one of many expenses that make the cost of being an automaker a likely barrier for a new entrant. Combining all these hurdles creates an industry that isn't likely to face any new entrants. However, because these hurdles are such a significant component of success, existing participants need to continuously try to improve their position; if they do not, they increase the probability of failure.

## DOES INDUSTRY RISK PUT A CEILING ON CREDIT QUALITY?

"The risks of doing business in some industries can be so great that it can put a limit on the credit quality of some and possibly all of the competitors in that industry."

- -Edward Tyburczy, Managing Director, Standard & Poor's

In the next chapters, we will discuss the key components that are included in a comprehensive credit review of the business and financial profiles of a company. While any one of those particular analytical categories can be an overriding determinant of credit quality, "the industry risk assessment goes a long way toward setting the upper limit on the (credit) rating to which any participant in the industry can aspire." 5

This is an extremely important point to understand. If the risks inherent in an industry (see Table 2-2) establish a certain amount of volatility or create a particular performance barrier that cannot be overcome, then that is a limit on the credit quality of the individual participants.

## Limits on Profits

One of the prime examples of an industry risk that could limit credit quality is the basic profitability of the sector. Profitability is the difference between revenues and expenses. To the extent that there is inflexibility in either revenue or expenses, there could be a limit to credit quality.

Executive management's job is to execute the strategy that maximizes its growth opportunities while optimally utilizing its capital. However, factors such as the level of competition, revenue growth, and capital intensity (which play a significant role in the profit margins and cash generation of a company and an industry) can be inflexible at times and restrict even the best management's strategies.

For example, there may be fierce competitors in some industries, so that the fight for customers and market share can occasionally prevent each competitor from growing revenue significantly. Of course, there are also industries with limited competition (monopolies and oligopolies). Analysts therefore must evaluate not only an industry's growth prospects in terms of revenue and net income (as covered in this chapter), but also the degree to which competition (or other factors such as regulation, discussed later in the chapter) affects the growth potential of the industry participants.

Restaurants and retail stores

Pharmaceutical and medical device companies

Regulated utilities

Publishing and broadcasting

As discussed, industries with limited growth potential can have limits to credit quality. Conversely, there are many sectors with steady revenue growth that favorably affects credit quality. With regard to both competition and industry growth, a careful examination of an individual company's market position is warranted.

## Capital Intensity

The entry capital requirements of a sector-and the continual investment needs-can directly affect the participants' ability to improve their profit margins or even to be profitable. While investing in the business (capital spending) is usually the fuel for new business growth, some sectors face a level of necessary spending that eats into either profitability or cash flow. Capital-intensive industries that also face intense competition and modest growth prospects typically are saddled with low profit margins. Examples of that type of industry sector are integrated steelmakers, tire and rubber companies, homebuilders, and the mining sector. There are also many positively structured industries that generate comparatively more revenue with each dollar of capital and may also be able to vary spending with cycles. Branded consumer products, pharmaceutical manufacturers, publishing, and broadcasting have some of the more favorable revenue and expense attributes.

Industries that have to spend their free cash to maintain or grow their business also face a limit to their credit quality. The oil and gas production business is an example. In this industry, the producers have to continually spend their cash to explore for, develop, and produce more oil and natural gas. Since their oil and gas reserves are continuously being depleted, if they do not keep up this spending, their financial performance will rapidly decline.

Industries that are susceptible to volatile commodity prices, such as oil and gas (and petrochemicals), are deeply affected by this uncertainty. The top-performing companies in these sectors balance their spending with the level of prices so as to moderate the need for more debt. That is, during periods when prices are high, these companies have the flexibility to invest more into the business, pay down debt, or build a cash horde. Each decision has a credit implication. During periods of low prices, these companies may be prepared for their lower revenues if they invested their money well. If they did not invest well, their credit quality will deteriorate. The point here is that there can be a limit to credit quality in indus-

tries with inherent commodity and spending risks, but it is how companies deal with those risks that sets the limit.

One last point on the oil and gas industry is to note that some of the strongest companies in the world are in this sector (e.g., Exxon Mobil, Chevron Texaco). While some of these firms were dealt a great hand as spin-offs from the John D. Rockefeller organization way back when, they have not permitted the industry's risk dynamics to lead to significant deterioration in their financial profiles.

## Industry Regulations

Specific industry regulations (and legal issues, e.g., those concerning asbestos and tobacco) can also put limits on credit quality, since they will affect business strategies and potential performance. For example, the regulated return on equity prescribed for utilities places a significant restriction on earnings growth. However, the certainty of that return, combined with the regulated right to recover prudent expenses, establishes a safety net for monopoly utilities. This typically results in good credit quality. Efforts by many regulators around the world to loosen up regulations, to establish some competition, and to permit more market pricing have hurt that sector's credit quality, and in many cases its financial performance. It's situations like this that require analysts to pay close attention to sector trends.

Lastly, strong (or weak) industry hurdles or barriers to entry can and will affect an industry's credit quality. Clearly, industries that require large amounts of capital, sophisticated technology, or extraordinary efforts to access customers or suppliers, or face that onerous regulatory requirement will have limits to the strengths of their participants' credit quality. The perverse situation, though, is that if a company can actually meet those requirements and its competitors cannot, it very possibly will have much higher credit quality. Conversely, sectors with low barriers will face heavy competition and possibly weak credit quality (e.g., Internet companies).

In any of these circumstances, industries with restrictive traits do not prevent all participants from having good credit quality, and sectors with supportive traits do not guarantee strong credit. But the degree of risk or volatility inherent in an industry's ability to grow its revenues, manage its costs, and be profitable will establish a range of possibilities for the industry players. Some will be limitless, and some limited. It's then

up to those companies to manage within or around the industry dynamics. These are the circumstances that drive corporations to acquire or merge with other companies.

Credit analysts should develop opinions on how inflexible an industry can be, determine what companies can and cannot achieve, and determine what it takes to succeed or fail. Identifying the industry leaders is a good start, since those companies by definition set the trends. Focusing on the best-performing companies in a given industry or sector is also very useful for comparison purposes and to understand the range of business strategies and performance possibilities in the sector.

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

## Industry Risks: The Critical Risk Factors for Company Analysis

Country and governmental risks establish a framework for the business environment-the rules of engagement. Industry risks are the dynamics built into an industry; they are special to each individual industry because of the type of product or service the industry is providing. All industry participants face the same inherent industry risks, but these risks may affect each company differently, especially since each company's management may react to the risks differently. Therefore, determining the potential impact of each risk on a credit is important.

In fact, identifying the inherent industry risks gives the credit analyst a starting point for the interrogation of a specific company and its particular credit risks. The factors of industry risk to focus on are the factors that can magnify or diminish the volatility of an individual company's performance. This chapter centers on sales growth prospects, patterns of cyclicality, and barriers to entry, and then asks whether the cumulative industry risks limit the credit quality of the sector's participants (see Table 2-3).

Industries can be segmented into five categories: growth, mature, niche, global, and highly cyclical. Each type of industry has different sales growth opportunities. A good metric for measuring industry growth and size is revenue generated by the entire industry. But it's the pace of that growth that triggers different management activities and thus has an influence on credit quality. An industry that typically is supportive of good credit quality would be one that is growing in size at a consistent pace because theoretically that could result in consistent individual manage-
ment strategies. Nevertheless, supportive industry growth or not, it's how a company pursues that growth that ultimately affects its credit quality.

The whole effort of evaluating sales growth patterns is complicated further by the cyclicality or seasonality inherent in an industry. Again,

managements react differently during these cycles. Credit analysts should monitor how each company spends its cash during the different cycles, since that will ultimately affect the need for further leveraging, and thus will affect the financial profile over the longer term.

Every industry has certain requirements that any company must meet if it is to participate and engage in business. Those barriers to entry can be either high or low, but they are nonetheless a mandatory entry ticket. These financial and nonfinancial hurdles can truly affect the level of success for individual companies and certainly influence the level of competition. For the credit analyst, the barriers are yet another factor to focus on. For example, a thorough assessment of a company's market position is necessary if an industry is determined to be highly competitive.

Now, through the second stage of the building-block methodology, credit analysts should be able to identify the most important industry risk factors. Combined with an understanding of the supportiveness of a country's laws, regulations, and infrastructure, industry risks further mold the possible credit quality of the industry's participants. Separately, each factor does not result in a credit or lending decision, but it is another important piece of information that leads to the decision. The question, though, remains whether industry risks can limit the credit quality of the industry's participants. The general answer is yes, if the risks restrict a company's ability to grow revenues, manage costs, be profitable, or just generate cash. The specific answer for any one credit can be different, though. It all depends on how its management responds to the dynamics of its industry and the business environment. So now, the analyst can focus on the risks inherent in an individual company.
