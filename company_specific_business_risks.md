## Company-Specific Business Risks

"Competition can be based on price, quality of product, distribution capabilities, image, product differentiation, service, or some other factor."

-Scott Sprinzen, Managing Director, Standard & Poor's

At this point of the analytical process, the critical role a sovereign government and country dynamics play relative to business and how much volatility is inherent in the relevant industry sector should already be understood. Based on this fundamental knowledge, the credit analyst's next step is to drill into a corporation's business to understand how it generates funds and how it spends those funds. A credit analyst also needs to know how stable or unstable that revenue stream and cash generation will be, and therefore how reliable the company is likely to be at repaying its financial obligations.

In that regard, then, the end result of business risk analysis should be a determination of a business's volatility. As we will suggest in Chapter 5, "Financial Risk Analysis," this is useful in establishing the appropriate financial performance for specific levels of credit quality. To effectively characterize business risk, we suggest in Chapter 10 the following fivepoint scale:

- ◆ Very high risk
- ◆ High risk
- ◆ Moderate risk
- ◆ Low risk
- ◆ Very low risk

As you go through each section of this chapter, keep the level of risk in mind. Business risk analysis starts with evaluating the products or services the company provides. As in the analysis of industry risks and opportunities, there are many factors to assess. For example, in Michael

Porter's book Competitive Strategy , he notes that a company's competitive position is influenced by "the five forces," namely, buyers, suppliers, industry competitors, potential new entrants, and substitute products and services. (See Figure 3-1.) In this book, we too stress competitor analysis and an entity's competitive position, and this chapter also has a focus on market position, business stability, regulations, and management.

The type and magnitude of competition, and the most important competitive factors, can and do differ industry by industry. (See Appendices A-G in which each case study refers to the industry's Keys to Success.) In corporate credit analysis, the basis for the evaluation of a company's competitive position should be the important factors that drive the company's success. Identifying these keys to success also allows analysts to compare that company to its industry peers. All of these factors can be characterized as a corporation's overall business profile.

## COMPETITIVE POSITION AND COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

The crux of good corporate credit analysis is accurately comparing one credit with another. Lenders of money and investors in securities essentially rank companies by their degree of quality (i.e., the strength of their ability to pay financial obligations) when determining what interest rate to charge or how much to pay for an investment. Comparing the strengths and weaknesses of different credits is a core activity of a credit analyst. (See Chapter 11, "Measuring Credit Risk.")

## Competitive Strategy

Related to this, analyzing a company's strengths and weaknesses relative to those of its business competitors is key to determining how successful the company will be in its business activities. Therefore, this is a critical component when analyzing a credit. In Competitive Strategy , 1 Michael Porter is talking directly to practitioners (i.e., corporate executives) on how best to win business competition. He writes:

The goal of competitive strategy for a business unit in an industry is to find a position in the industry where the company can best defend itself against these competitive forces or can influence them in its favor.

Since the collective strength of the forces may well be painfully apparent to all competitors, the key for developing strategy is to delve below the surface and analyze the sources of each. Knowledge of these underlying sources of competitive pressure highlights the critical strengths and weaknesses of the company, animates its positioning in its industry, clarifies the areas where strategic change may yield the greatest payoff, and highlights the areas where industry trends promise to hold the greatest significance as either opportunities or threats.

## The Competitive Factors

All industries have multiple keys to success and critical competitive factors. Price, quality, customer service, and the ability to deliver on time and

in quantity are fairly typical competitive factors, especially in business-tobusiness situations. Price, quality, image, shelf space, repeat business, and product familiarity are also reasons why consumers buy products. The type of industry may matter; that is, it may matter whether the industry is a global, mature, growth, or niche industry because the nature of competition in a particular type of industry could differ from that in other types.

Analysts utilizing the building-block methodology will conduct an industry risk assessment and will therefore identify the critical factors for analyzing specific company risks. Many of those risks will be key competitive factors, too.

To determine the critical keys to winning the competition, credit analysts should focus not only on the primary competitive factors but, most importantly, on the underlying factors that influence and ultimately determine the winners and losers. For example, if an industry were determined to be highly competitive, a careful assessment of the firm's market position would be one of the focuses. More specifically, if a company competes on price, the underlying factor will be its costs. The lowest-cost supplier is best able to reduce its prices and maintain profitable margins (and thus win the price competition).

An excellent example is Southwest Airlines and Jet Blue, whose operating costs (i.e., costs per available seat mile) are at least 30 percent lower than those that of the larger major airline competitors (see Figure 3-2). If competition is on quality, the underlying factor is the skills of the company's people or the abilities of the manufacturing facilities. If competition is on the ability to deliver, then the breadth of distribution outlets or the speed of manufacturing is key. Technology and health-care companies compete on innovation. The key to their success is innovation and the ability to create the next valued product that consumers want, need, and are willing to purchase.

There are many ways to compare competitors. The key is to be comprehensive. In doing a cost comparison, think about the entire operation. For example, most companies have energy costs, manufacturing costs, distribution costs, construction costs, labor costs, financing costs, and taxes (to name just a few). Managers are always looking for ways to be operationally efficient or to get economies of scale because it helps their competitive position. Efficiencies and economies can be in manufacturing, distribution, marketing, purchasing, administration, or finance. In other words, efficiencies are sought in every operation within the company and in every location. Analysts should be comparing competitors along these same lines.

## MARKET POSITION, SALES GROWTH, AND PRICING ARE INTERRELATED

"The Corporation is one of the world's largest and most diversified manufacturers of softgoods for apparel and interior furnishings. It is a leading developer, marketer, and manufacturer of fabrics and other textile products used in a wide variety of . . ."

-Burlington Industries Inc., September 30, 2000, SEC Form 10-K

"As a leading supplier across all distribution channels, Pillowtex sells its products to most major mass merchants, department stores, and specialty retailers. . . . Pillowtex is one of the largest firms in the home textile industry and has significant competitive strengths."

-Pillowtex Corporation, January 1, 2000, SEC Form 10-K

Big deal! Do not be fooled by a corporation's marketing spin. Nearly every company says it is one of the leaders in its business. The word leading is possibly the most used and abused word in financial statement reporting history. In most cases, a company's representation of its market position is deceptive and can mislead analysts into believing that the company's products and services are stronger, better positioned, and more profitable than they really are. For two real-life examples of misleading market positions, look no further than Burlington Industries Inc. (filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2001) and Pillowtex Corp. (filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000)! Clearly, their products' market positions were not strong enough to keep these companies successful.

The strength of a product's market position is an extremely important element of credit analysis. Understanding product strength (i.e., market position) helps credit analysts determine a company's ability to generate consistent sales demands, to achieve the product's potential sales growth, and to maintain pricing power.

The reality is that not every company can be the sales leader of its industry, and that even being tops in sales does not guarantee profitability. Even more confusing is that many times the number two or number three company in sales is more successful than the industry leader. General Motors sells more cars than any other automaker in the United States, but by many other measures Toyota can be considered the most successful company in the industry. 2 Furthermore, unfortunately, in some industries, being number two can significantly diminish success and therefore credit quality. This sometimes is because the market is not big enough for multiple products, but most of the time it is because a company's products are not meeting customers' needs.

## Market Share

Still, market share analysis can unlock some mysteries. To start with, analysts must make sure to conduct the analysis on a company's main markets or products and not dilute the analysis by combining too many products or attempting to analyze the company's share of small markets. For example, in analyzing a surgical supplies distributor, it is better to focus on its market share in the surgical supplies industry, rather than its share of just one product, because of the relatively small revenue base for each product. However, in analyzing pharmaceutical manufacturers, the market share of individual drug products is important because the

revenues generated by some drugs are in the billions of dollars.

Translating market share is a bit tricky. Having the highest market share is a goal for most firms, but having it does not necessarily translate into a competitive advantage or dominance. Highly fragmented industries may have multiple "leading providers," depending on how they calculate their shares. Determining whether a certain level of market share is positive or negative has a great deal to do with the level of competition. Having 40 percent of a two-product market could be poor performance, while having 20 percent of a fragmented market could be highly successful. Either way, market share analysis is not a static one-time effort. It should be done over a continuum. The trends that develop are the telltale signs of growth or deterioration. Furthermore, entities or products that are increasing their market share may also be achieving a degree of price leadership. The reverse is true, too. This phenomenon does not happen overnight, which is why share analysis is a long-term process.

## Product and Sales Diversity

Most industries have a broad range of different buyers of their products and services. The stronger credits have products or services that are differentiated from competing products and are desired by customers. For these entities, this creates a bargaining power that then translates into consistent sales demand and, importantly, a measure of pricing power as well. For some companies, this power can be sustained, but for many others, it is fleeting and subject to the swings in the economy or customer whims. The successful companies understand the strengths of their products and know the demands of their customers, and therefore they become consistently better at delivering what the market wants or needs. Many times that means retrofitting the quality or other attributes of the product to meet customer requirements. Most of the time it reflects a deep understanding of a market and its trends, resulting in shifting marketing, packaging, distribution, and pricing strategies in response to those trends. In essence, the stronger companies can target customers at the right time with the right product and deliver it at a profitable price. Companies that do this well achieve a greater percentage of the growth in sales in their products. The weaker companies unfortunately do not find a strength in their products, don't know their customers well enough, don't attract enough sales demand, and ultimately end up just cutting price (and thus profitability) so as to clear inventory.

Since most companies have many products, it is very difficult-if not impossible-for credit analysts to understand a management's strategies for each and every product. But it isn't necessary, either. Instead, analysts should evaluate the industry trends, competitor trends, consumer trends, and the individual management's broad and specific strategies, and then the consistency of the company's sales performance.

Take Procter & Gamble, for example. For 20 years it has been one of the most successful consumer products companies, and it continues to be so, as evidenced by its consistent revenue and income growth (shown in Figure 3-3). While all consumer products are fraught with risk based on consumer whims, Procter & Gamble has consistently sold its many and varied products. Analysts would find it impossible to evaluate management's strategies for each and every one of Procter & Gamble multitude of products. Instead, it's much easier and more useful to evaluate the trends and forecasts for personal care products, management's overall strategy for new product development, and the company's track record.

## Sales Consistency versus the Economy

Consistency, and conversely volatility, of sales and revenue are what a credit analyst is trying to determine. Consistent sales growth and pricing power are two of the marks of good credit. As stated in prior chapters, analysts should evaluate the consistency and growth prospects inherent in an economy and in an industry, and compare them to the company's performance. By combining this with an opinion of a company's product strength versus competitors' strengths, analysts can then project sales growth and pricing trends.

As an example, during a positive economic environment and in an industry with growing customer demands, a company with a strong product position can be expected to grow its sales at a faster rate than its competitors and increase its prices at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of inflation. In an economic or industry slowdown, the same company would still achieve better growth rates than its competitors, but its year-over-year sales and revenue comparisons would be weaker. Companies with average or weak market positions strive to achieve consistency (and rarely have it) and seek to achieve the growth rates inherent in their industry. During good economic periods, it's possible for companies with weak market positions to achieve healthy sales growth year over year. But when the economy weakens or when the industry slows down, weaker-positioned companies are negatively affected to a greater degree and faster than the stronger entities.

## BUSINESS CONSISTENCY AND STABILITY

The consistency and stability of a corporation's businesses (measured by revenue, unit sales, profitability, and cash flow) are a key component of credit analysis, with consistency being considered a strength and volatility a weakness. Volatility occurs for many reasons, including the effects of business and economic cycles, competitive factors, product obsolescence, technological innovations, and, in general, shifts in demand for a company's products or services.

Companies achieve business stability by having either a strong competitive position supported by quality products or services with strong enough market positions to withstand shifts in the business and general economies, or significant diversity and managerial skill to navigate through the economic shifts. Business stability does not mean that a company's financial and operating performances remain unchanged. On the

contrary, business stability assumes that management can successfully proceed with its strategies with confidence because of the financial and nonfinancial strength of its operations. Yet if a company has a good measure of stability, there can be a more certain predictability of its cash flow generation.

The credit analyst's job is to incorporate the certainty or the uncertainty derived from the company's consistency or volatility into the credit decision. Since competitive position and market position were covered in this chapter already, this section will focus on the diversity of assets.

## Operational Diversity

The breadth of an organization can be an important ingredient that brings stability to a business. But the sheer mass of assets is not as important as how that size and assets are used. In fact, a poorly utilized large asset usually becomes a larger financial headache than a poorly utilized small asset. Enron and WorldCom were huge companies that failed because of massive fraud that was designed to hide the fact that their businesses were not as successful as they were purported to be.

Yet being large does have its benefits. First of all, large corporations, whether they are national or global, mature or in growth mode, typically have some measure of operational diversity. Operational diversity could be several businesses, product lines, manufacturing plants, distribution outlets, or even types of customers. The benefit of true diversity is that it helps to smooth out the effects of business cycles and other more specific business developments. That is, if there is a sales slowdown in one business or a problem with one aspect of a business (e.g., a customer or a manufacturing plant), a diverse company could shift its activities to focus on its other assets. That's a clear advantage over small entities, which are usually more concentrated in terms of products, customers, suppliers, and geography, and may be unable to make similar shifts in activities. Credit analysts should be aware of this flexibility and determine whether a company is actually capable of using it. If so, then it is a strength.

Diversification often affects competition, too. When considering the barriers or hurdles to entry in a business (discussed in Chapter 2), larger entities are likely to have better diverse access to buyers and suppliers and therefore theoretically better competitive positions than small entities. That, of course, is a general statement that can be refuted at times in

specific situations. The best contrarian example is Microsoft, a very small company in the mid-1980s that had no particular advantages compared to the industry behemoth IBM. Yet it grew to be one of the largest, most successful companies in the world within 10 years via deft product management. (Microsoft's initial success was purchasing a disk operating system, DOS, from another small firm and then convincing IBM to incorporate DOS into its personal computers. See Microsoft's growth in revenue and income in Figure 3-4.) Today, Microsoft is a massive organization that utilizes its size advantages. It is the industry behemoth whose products have a dominant market position over customers and suppliers, who is a technology advancement leader, and who has billions of dollars of available cash to withstand enormous changes in its business environment.

The lesson is that large firms do have several advantages because of their size, but, while this is rare, small companies can succeed if they achieve a demonstrable market advantage. Therefore, market share analysis as discussed earlier in this chapter can provide some insight into a company's competitive position and thus another aspect of the stability of its business.

## Financial Diversity

Operational diversity provides financial stability in a number of ways, one of which is by having a revenue, expense, and income mix coming from diverse products, plants, customers, and regions. While it may be unrealistic to look for perfect diversity, many organizations get significant stability in their financial performance by having multiple businesses delivering varied portions of their revenue and income. In these cases, management has the flexibility to shift resources (e.g., capital spending, marketing activities, human resources) among the business units based on the economic or business environment-and even during different business cycles or seasons-and still expect a consistent financial performance. Companies with dominant business units may achieve consistent financial performance for many reasons, but they probably do not have the same flexibility as a diverse company.

A good example is General Motors, which attempted to create diversity in the 1980s by purchasing Hughes Aircraft Corp. (later named Hughes Electronics Corp.) for $5.7 billion and Electronic Data Systems Corp. for $2.55 billion. But despite these huge investments, GM ultimately never created enough diversity because its automotive business continued to be the prevailing entity driving its credit quality. Eventually, these investments did pay benefits, as GM sold them off (in several increments) for substantial sums, bolstering its liquidity when cash generation from the automotive business was weak.

## Asset Flexibility

Large companies often have some measure of financial flexibility because they have peripheral assets that they can sell in times of need. While this can be favorable for credit quality, asset sales should not always be viewed positively. Asset sales can be viewed negatively if the financial contribution from the departed asset will be missed (that is, if it is a key component of income and cash flow) or if the sale recognizes the failure to make the asset valuable enough to retain (and brings into question the success and value of other businesses). Conversely, being able to dispose of an asset that is not important to financial performance and turning that cash into something valuable is certainly positive. Still, corporations are not expected to make a regular practice of liquidating their assets, and companies that regularly sell off assets to support their capital needs have to be viewed skeptically. At some point, though, asset sales can cease to

be an option if a company exhausts the assets it has available to sell or the marketplace devalues the asset (if the company is viewed as being desperate to sell it). The credit analyst's responsibility is to calculate the benefit or detriment from the asset sale and subsequent use of proceeds.

Lack of flexibility is negative for all companies, especially small firms and those in cyclical industries. A simple setback for some companies could be a disaster for an entity without the financial wherewithal to survive it. Besides being able to sell off noncore assets, large companies can at times have a better ability to withstand economic or industry downturns because they are relied on by many others. Bankers, business counterparts, and employees might possibly be more tolerant during downturns and more willing to renegotiate agreements because of the importance of their business relationship.

For instance, a bank's exposure to a firm, especially a large one, can be quite extensive. Typically, when a company is struggling, banks waive covenant violations (albeit at higher banking fees) and may even lend more money to the entity if the bank evaluates the company as having reasonable longer-term prospects-that is, if it is confident that the company will be able to pay its financial obligations over the longer term. Small entities do not always get that sort of treatment from banks because they are often not as established in their business, do not have extensive business relationships to keep the business going, and do not have the financial support (cash or asset value) to give the bank collateral protection. Business counterparties may also give a company some leeway in a specific business deal if the overall relationship was important or difficult to replace. For example, union negotiations are always contentious, but ultimately employees do not want to lose their jobs by driving the company to be uncompetitive or in bankruptcy. In all of these cases, the balance of power in the negotiations can shift quickly, depending on which party has the leverage. Large corporations frequently have this leverage. Credit analysts should recognize the benefits of size but cannot take a company's size at face value. Instead analysts should evaluate how effective management is at taking advantage of the company's physical strengths.

## REGULATIONS

"Regulations set the rules but they don't guarantee success or failure. How management plays by the rules determines it."

-Ron Barone, Managing Director, Standard & Poor's

If cyclicality and volatility are potential negatives, then the stability provided by governmental or regulatory rules is a positive. Correct? Not exactly. The impact of regulations can be quite varied-from benign to adversarial and from supportive to a hindrance. For it to be viewed favorably, regulatory treatment should be transparent and timely, and should allow for consistent financial performance. Yet that is not always the case. But whatever its impact is, it affects all companies in an industry. Ultimately, though, if all companies in a sector are playing by the same rules, then it is the effectiveness of a company's business strategies and execution that decides its credit quality, not how supportive the regulations are.

There can be many types of regulation. In Chapter 1 we discussed:

- ◆ How governments set the basic business rules and regulations in their particular region (local or national)
- ◆ The very wide range of areas that regulations can cover, including export/import restrictions, competition boundaries, service quality guidelines, antitrust legislation, subsidies, and the percentage of local or foreign ownership
- ◆ That regulations can and do affect the business strategies of individual companies

Every industry has certain regulatory requirements or constraints that influence business performance and how decisions are made. For example, forest products entities (paper mill operators, wood products manufacturers, and so on) have restrictions on tree cutting; oil and natural gas producers have rules on drilling wells; agricultural firms get subsidies; airlines have many operational rules; and many, if not all, companies must adhere to environmental guidelines.

Regulations on utilities (telephone, electricity, natural gas, and water) are even more influential, since local and national regulators set utility rates and therefore establish how utilities recover their costs and make a profit. Consequently, for much of the twentieth century, utilities were viewed as very strong credits because their financial performance had a certain safety net below it, creating something of a floor on performance. The fact that utilities had typically faced little or no competition also contributed to their strong credit quality. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, some aspects of U.S. telephone, electricity, and natural gas utilities (not water utilities) were deregulated by either national regulators or local regulators. In most cases this eliminated rate setting on portions of the

business and created free-market pricing instead. Therefore, parts of the utilities' businesses faced competition for the first time, e.g., the long-distance telephone business and the selling of electricity and natural gas. 3

## Regulatory Decisions

Around the world, the ways in which regulatory decisions are made can be very different and will reflect the unique circumstances, history, political parties in power, and culture of a country. For example, some political systems require legislative action in order to modify regulations, while other systems create separate regulatory bodies to make decisions. It's debatable as to which is the more supportive system for a company's performance and for a credit decision. It usually comes down to a case-bycase evaluation. Either way, no matter which industry is involved, there typically are agendas (some more politically motivated than others) in conflict with each other that eventually have to be resolved, such as:

- ◆ Establishing the lowest rates possible or supporting business growth with healthy investment returns
- ◆ Creating competition in the market or restricting foreign competition
- ◆ Providing outright support for struggling companies or permitting business failures
- ◆ Being environmentally friendly or building manufacturing capacity to meet consumer demands

The credit analyst's role, then, is to determine how influential those regulations are and their impacts on the revenue and income of a company, as well as its ability to compete. Do they set a floor on financial performance or a ceiling? Are they a safety net, or do they tie the company in knots? Also, since politicians inherently influence regulations, they are subject to change. Analysts have to pay very close attention to regulatory activity, because if there is a change, it could have a major impact on the credit decision. Like most political decisions, though, the process of getting regulatory action can be long-drawn-out and tortuous. Yet analysts have to follow all the twists and turns because many credit decisions just cannot wait for a regulatory body to make a decision. The analyst's current prediction of the regulatory outcome and its impact on the company will be a critical component of the credit decision.

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

## Business Risks

Business risks can be defined as all the factors that affect a company's financial performance and influence the specific strategy that its management employs. The risks themselves initially develop from the basic risks inherent in the industry or in the country in which a particular company operates. Analysts utilizing the building-block methodology will be able to identify the key factors to focus on for a company and eventually narrow down to the most important issues. Competitor analysis and an entity's competitive position are critically important to analyze, and this chapter also has focused on market position, business stability, and regulations.

Competitive analysis is, in essence, a comparison of one company versus another company. Identifying the key factors that a company competes on is the critical first step. Most competition is based on price, quality, customer service, and the ability to deliver in quantity and on time. But the important next step for credit analysts is to recognize the underlying factors that influence and ultimately determine the winners and losers in competition. For example, if competition is on price, the underlying driving factor will be a company's cost base versus its competitors'. That's where analysts should focus their time.

The strength of a company's market position is a very important part of credit analysis. It helps determine the consistency of sales demand and pricing power, which are two key components of a strong credit. Market share analysis can help, but it's important not to get fooled by market share. Most companies call themselves leaders in their industry, but that may not mean that they are strong credits or even successful. How markets are defined and how share is calculated can be of consequence. Since most companies have many products and services, narrow definitions of market share are not useful. Following the broader industry, consumer, and competitor trends is significant. The consistency of a company's performance is a result of the strength of its products and management strategies that develop and enhance those strengths.

Consistency and stability are considered strengths in credit analysis, whereas volatility is a weakness. Companies achieve consistency and stability through strong competitive positions and/or strong market positions that help them to withstand shifts in the business or economic environments. Diversity, too, brings stability. Having several business, product lines, manufacturing plants, distribution outlets, or even types of cus-

tomers can help to smooth out the effects of a business cycle. Varied access to buyers and suppliers can also benefit a company's competitive stance.

Financial flexibility is typical of good credits, and inflexibility can be disastrous for weak companies. Financial flexibility can come from diverse sources of revenues and income, or from a varied ability to access cash. In all of these circumstances, large companies have an advantage over small companies. Yet analysts cannot take a company's size for granted; instead, they should evaluate how well management utilizes its company's size and diversity.

Regulations can create stability, but not necessarily at a high performance level. Indeed, some regulations can be a real hindrance to the success of a company. It's the analyst's job to determine how regulations affect a company and its performance.

Analyzing the quality of the asset base and the business in general cannot be completed without an evaluation of the management team. The next chapter studies management's policies, philosophies, and performance.
